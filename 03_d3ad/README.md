# The *d3ad* Virus
This is one of my best homemade Python viruses so far.

## How does it strike?
This virus strikes by creating creepy files in the Desktop and also opening some Pop-ups and minimizing every app you open.

Creepy, right?

## Requirements
To run this, you'll need Standard Modules and pyautogui.
