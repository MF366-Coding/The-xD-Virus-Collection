The program you are about to run is considered malware. If you are running this in a safe environment and want to test this app, go ahead and press Yes! but note that THE CREATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO ANY COMPUTER'S COMPONENT! If you are not running this in a safe environment or just opened this app by mistake, just click No! and nothing will happen. Btw I'm on GitHub (MF366-Coding) xD .///Are you sure you would like to run malware, knowing it might break your computer?! Remember: THE CREATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE AT ALL! So, still wanna run it?!
