# The Scary Virus
This is a Python homemade computer virus that works on Windows only due to commands in the Command Prompt. Please note that this malware is **not destructive** even tho it is still malware.

## How does it strike?
This is the dumbest virus I ever created: it literally only shows some pop-ups and then dies.

## Requirements
You'll need the following non-standard modules:

- pyautogui

## Where can I download it?
You can find it in the Releases Section on my GitHub repo (The Smiley Face Virus Collection).
